                Hello! My name is Edward and I am passionate about web development.
                </p>
                <p>
I started my educational career studying Electrophysics. After gaining admission into Columbia University, I completed a Masters degree in Electronics Engineering. I decided to further my education with an additional Masters degree from San Jose State in Computer Engineering. As a result of my background, I have a rather strong grasp of engineering and have become attuned to problem solving related to complex problems.                    
                </p>
                <p>
My passion for web development led me to further supplement my education with a certificate from Udacity in Senior Web Development. Udacity has partnered with tech giants such as Google and Facebook to create more relevant industry credentials with a more project based approach.                
                </p>
                <p>
I am currently looking for a challenging opportunity which will allow me to apply my skills and talents in front-end web development.                   
                </p>
                <p>
